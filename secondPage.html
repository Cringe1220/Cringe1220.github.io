        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <pre style="color: white; background: black 1px; " >Who am I? Well, where do I start?! I am a human. Obviously.
        I am Currently enrolled in University for Computer Science. So on this website you'll 
        find most of my projects and things I do on my own time and for class. So get ready.
        I am an 18 year old boy. who has not been affected by Covid-19. Ha, never had it. 
        Work experiance wise, Ive been a labour man at a construction and landscaping company
        laying sod and concrete all day, wasn't my favorite job. I was the youngest and targeted
        because I was the best. S=I am currently a bartender at a convention/events center. 
        Self-employed at an early age. As a lawncare kid. That pretty much sums up my work experiance
        Hobbies? What are my hobbies. Well I play semi-professional Paintball. Played Paintball for 
        my whole life, well, since I was 12. Not well though. Other than that, I've been coding
        my own games in PyGame for pretty much my entire early years. I have my own experiance
        building and repairing computers hardware. And building my own software. Coding my own.
